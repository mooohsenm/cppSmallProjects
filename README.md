# C/C++ Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini projects written in C and C++. Each project is a small, self-contained program that demonstrates various concepts and techniques in C/C++. Feel free to explore the projects and use them as a reference or inspiration for your own projects.

## Projects List

1. [**Project 1:** Calculator in C.](Simple_Calculator.c)

   This project is a console-based calculator program implemented in C. It provides various mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, factorial, sine, and cosine. The program displays a menu with options for the user to choose from, and it continues to execute until the user selects the exit option. The calculator uses functions for each mathematical operation, making the code modular and easier to understand. Overall, it's a simple yet effective calculator application for basic mathematical calculations.
   
   
2. [**Project 2:** Student Record Management System in C.](Student_Record_Management_System.c)

   This project is a simple student record management system implemented in C. It allows users to perform various operations such as adding a new student record, displaying a student record, deleting a student record, filling in the marks of a student record, searching for a student, and displaying a report card of a specific student. The program uses a struct to store student information such as ID, name, birth date, address, class, emergency contact, and average. It also uses a 2D array to store student marks for different subjects. The system provides a user-friendly menu interface for easy navigation.

   
3. [**Project 3:** Stone-Paper-Scissor Game in C++.](Stone_Paper_Scissor_Game.cpp)

   Rock, Paper, Scissors Game: A simple console-based game implemented in C++ where the player competes against the computer. The game allows the player to choose from three options (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) for a specified number of rounds. The winner of each round is determined based on the classic rules of the game. At the end of the game, the total number of rounds played, as well as the number of wins for each player and the number of draws, are displayed. Players can choose to play multiple rounds and the game keeps track of the overall winner.


4. [**Project 4:** Math Game in C++.](Simple_Math_Game.cpp)

   This project is a console-based math quiz program implemented in C++. It allows the user to choose the number of questions, the difficulty level (easy, medium, hard, or mixed), and the type of operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, mixed). The program generates random math questions based on the user's choices and evaluates the user's answers. At the end of the quiz, it displays the user's score and whether they passed or failed. The program also offers the option to play the quiz again.

5. [**Project 5:** Meeting Room Reservation System C.](Meeting_Room_Reservation_System.c)

   This project, titled "Meeting Room Reservation System", is a console-based application written in C. It is designed to manage and schedule meeting room reservations in an organized dynamic manner using linked list data structure. Key features of the system include:

      1. **Reservation Management**: Users can create, view, and delete reservations. Each reservation includes details such as the room ID, reservation date, and start and end times.

      2. **Room Status Tracking**: Each room's reservation status is tracked. When a reservation is deleted, the room's status is updated to not reserved, and its associated date and time details are reset.

      3. **Reservation Search**: The system provides functionality to search for reservations by ID. If a reservation with the given ID is found, its details are displayed. If not, a message is shown indicating that the reservation was not found.

      4. **User Interface**: The system provides a console-based user interface with clear prompts and messages to guide the user through the process of managing reservations.

6. [**Project 6:** Bank Management System in c++.](Bank_System.cpp)

   This project is a console-based simple bank management system implemented in C++. It allows users to perform basic banking operations such as adding new clients, updating client information, depositing and withdrawing funds, and viewing client lists and balances. The system stores client data in a text file and provides a command-line interface for interacting with the system.
